I am a final year BS CS student (aspiring for Ph.D.) at the Lahore University of Management Science. I am broadly interested in the domains of security and privacy with a particular emphasis on making the systems we employ safer and reliable. As one of the top-ranked students at Pakistan's premier institute, I find myself driven to channel my learnings toward creating real-world impact. To this end, I have actively pursued research opportunities that have come my way, allowing me to observe firsthand the potential risks posed to everyday users by systems that create a false sense of trust and safety. 


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
